title: Sensor to control
page_id: sensor_to_control

This page is meant as an introduction and overview of the path from
sensor acquisition to motor control. In order to understand the details
of each of the step the best is to read the code, but it\'s not trivial
to understand the flow. Therefore this should be seen more as a map of
where to look in the code to understand, than a complete documentation
of each step.
